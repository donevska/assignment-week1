    <h1>Cat's Cradle</h1>
    <p>
      Cat's Cradle is a satirical postmodern novel, with science fiction
      elements, by American writer Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut's fourth novel, it
      was first published in 1963, exploring and satirizing issues of science,
      technology, the purpose of religion, and the arms race, often through the
      use of black humor. After turning down his original thesis in 1947, the
      University of Chicago awarded Vonnegut his master's degree in anthropology
      in 1971 for Cat's Cradle.
