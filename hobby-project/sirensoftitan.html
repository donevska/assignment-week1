    <h1>Sirens of Titan</h1>
    <p>
      The Sirens of Titan is a comic science fiction novel by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,
      first published in 1959. His second novel, it involves issues of free
      will, omniscience, and the overall purpose of human history. Much of the
      story revolves around a Martian invasion of Earth. This novel begins with
      an omniscient comment: "Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life
      within himself. But mankind wasn't always so lucky."
