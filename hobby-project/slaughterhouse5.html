    <p>
      Slaughterhouse-Five, or, The Children's Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death
      is a 1969 semi-autobiographic science fiction-infused anti-war novel by
      Kurt Vonnegut. It follows the life and experiences of Billy Pilgrim, from
      his early years, to his time as an American soldier and chaplain's
      assistant during World War II, to the post-war years, with Billy
      occasionally traveling through time. The text centers on Billy's capture
      by the German Army and his survival of the Allied firebombing of Dresden
      as a prisoner of war, an experience which Vonnegut himself lived through
      as an American serviceman. The work has been called an example of
      "unmatched moral clarity" and "one of the most enduring anti-war novels of
      all time".
